# VESC_Arduino_Library!

This is a library to control a VESC using an Arduino compatible board. It has only been tested with an STM32F103C8 blue pill board. It should work with all Arduino-Comptaible boards with more than 1 serial bus. 
This library uses Serial1 to communicate with the VESC, and leaves Serial unused so that we can use it to communicate via USB.

## *THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!*

You can try this library, most things work, but I can't guarantee anything.
