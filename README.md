# VESC_Arduino_Library!

This is a library to control a VESC (or two, via CAN BUS) using an Arduino compatible board. It won't compile for low memory chips like the ATMega328p found in the Nano and Uno boards. It will, however, compile on Mega 2560 and STM32F103 boards, like the BluePill.

## *THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!*

Right now this is a WIP and nothing has been tested. Only the "set" features should work.
